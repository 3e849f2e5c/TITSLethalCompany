# TITS Integration
A mod for Lethal Company that hooks into [TITS (Twitch Integrated Throwing System)](https://remasuri3.itch.io/tits) to spawn thrown items and damage the player.

## Important Notes
1. You must launch TITS **before** you start a game or connect to a server. If you launch TITS after loading into a game you need to reconnect to exit to main menu and reconnect or start the server again.
   
2. For best results everyone on the server needs the mod installed.
    - If you turn off Stun Grenade pin pulling only the host and the player running TITS need the mod installed.
    - If you also turn off item spawning and only have damage enabled only the player running TITS needs the mod regardless if they are the host or not
