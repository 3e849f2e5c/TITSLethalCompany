# T.I.T.S Integration
A mod for Lethal Company
that hooks into [T.I.T.S (Twitch Integrated Throwing System)](https://remasuri3.itch.io/tits) to spawn thrown items
and damage the player.

## Important Notes
1. You must launch T.I.T.S **before** you start a game or connect to a server. If you launch T.I.T.S after loading into a game you need to exit to the main menu and reconnect or start the server again.
   
2. For best results everyone on the server needs the mod installed.
    - If you turn off Stun Grenade pin pulling only the host and the player running T.I.T.S need the mod installed.
    - If you also turn off item spawning and only have damage enabled only the player running T.I.T.S needs the mod regardless if they are the host or not.
